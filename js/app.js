//  The Game of Tic Tac Toe
//  Two players will choose tiles for their letter
	// playerOne = 'X';
	// playerTwo = 'O';

// Start Over button should clear the board for players to play the game.
	// innerText in h3 tag should populate with "It is X's turn"


// The first player will always be 'X' when starting the game, playerTwo will always be 'O'

// When the first player clicks a tile:
	// the innerText of the tile should be updated with the letter of the player ('X')
	// value should be stored in a variable (document.getElementsByClassName)
	// data-value of letter should be stored
	// innerText of the h3 tag should be updated to say 'It is O's turn"

// Next click action should alternate to populate an 'O' in the tile clicked:
	//Make it so that nothing happens if an already-'clicked' square is clicked
	//Hint: check if the className includes what you are looking for

	// var playerOne will be an array that will store the class of the tile clicked by player 'X'
	// var playerTwo will be an array that will store the class of the tile clicked by player 'O'
